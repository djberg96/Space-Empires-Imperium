This is a personal mashup of the old GDW sci-fi game *Imperium* and the more modern *Space Empires: 4x* by GMT.

The text is written using LaTeX. To convert .tex files into PDF's you should
install some flavor of LaTeX (basictex, mactex, etc) and run the following on your terminal:

`pdflatex --jobname Space_Empires_Imperium main.tex`

Simply replace the jobname and 'main.tex' with whatever the actual filename is, and your desired output file name.
