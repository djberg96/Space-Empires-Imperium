\section{INTRODUCTION}
\hfill

\textit{Space Empires: Imperium} is a personal mashup of the old GDW sci-fi game \textit{Imperium} and the more modern GMT game \textit{Space Empires: 4x} and its expansions. However, I have also added some of my own touches that do not exist in either of those games.

The result is a game that is (hopefully) more interesting for a modern gaming audience within a hobby that has had decades of evolution since the original \textit{Imperium} was released.

A quick summary of changes include the use of ships and technology from \textit{Space Empires: 4x} (as well as its combat system), a deck of cards that add various events and actions that deliberately introduce some chaos into the game, and a modified sequence of play.
