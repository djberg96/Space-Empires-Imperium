\section{IMPERIUM CARDS}
\hfill

This variant adds a deck of cards (henceforth the Imperium Deck) that both players will use over the course of the game. These cards can affect movement, production and combat in various ways. They are also used to resolve Imperial Intervention as well as Appeals to the Emperor. This adds a bit of flavor and chaos to the game and, hopefully, makes the game a bit more interesting.

Shuffle the cards in the Imperium Deck and place it face down somewhere within easy reach of both players. All cards in the Imperium Deck remain face down until drawn.

\subsection{Deal the Cards}

At the start of a war, each player receives cards from the Imperium Deck equal to the number of worlds they control. This is considered your minimum hand size.

\textit{For the first scenario, for example, each player would receive three cards.}

The cards in your hand are secret and should be kept hidden from your opponent until played. The cards in the discard pile are public knowledge and can be inspected at any time.

\subsection{Drawing More Cards}

During each player's maintenance and production phase the active player draws a number of cards that brings them back up to their minimum hand size (if below the minimum). After drawing up to your minimum hand size the active player may discard cards for 3 RU each. Cards discarded in this fashion are not replaced until the following turn.

You may also buy additional cards at a cost of 7 RU per card. You may not discard a card that you purchased for RU in the same turn that you purchased it.

\subsection{Playing the Cards}

A card may only be played during the phase specified at the top of the card. Each player may only play one card per phase or sub-phase, e.g. you could play one battle card during the space combat sub-phase, and one during the surface combat sub-phase.

In battle, the attacker plays their card first. In other phases, the first player (e.g. the Terran player in the First War scenario) plays their card first.

When playing a card from your hand refer to the event section of the card for its effects.

\subsubsection{Imperial Intervention}

A card is drawn to resolve \textit{Imperial Intervention} instead of dice. Draw a card from the top of the Imperium Deck and refer to the appropriate section on the bottom of the card to determine the result, if any.

\subsection{Hand Limit}

You may hold a maximum number of cards in your hand equal to the combined number of connected worlds and outposts that you control. If you draw cards in excess of this number, you must immediately discard down to your hand limit.

\subsection{Discards and Reshuffling}

Cards played over the course of the game are placed into a discard pile. The moment the last card is drawn from the deck, reshuffle all of the discarded back into the Imperium Deck.

\textit{Note that some cards may also cause the discarded cards to be reshuffled back into the deck earlier than expected!}

\subsection{Between Wars}

Cards may not be held between wars. Any cards still in your hand at the end of the final turn of the game must either be discarded for 3 RU each, or used to automatically pay the maintenance cost of a ship instead of rolling, one card per ship.

\subsection{Card Manifest}

Below is a description of each card in the deck, when it can be played, and the quantity in parenthesis. Any clarifications are also included.

In the interests of brevity, the term "sub-phase" has been dropped, e.g. "Space Combat" refers to the Space Combat Sub-phase, and the term "PS/SI" refers to the Planetary Surface/Surface Interaction Sub-phase.

\subsubsection{Call to Arms} (2)

When: Space Combat, at start of second round of combat.

Ships in an adjacent, connected system may join a battle at the start of the second round of combat.

\subsubsection{Close the Range} (2)

When: Start of Space Combat.

Treat all missile fire by your opponent as \textit{Short Range Missile Fire} during this space combat when at long range.

\textit{Clarification: This card does not affect short range, i.e. SRMF still fires after beam weapons at half strength when at short range.}

\subsubsection{Commandos} (2)

When: PS/SI.

During this combat your regular troops may land without a transport. Your jump troops may not be fired on by PD units or Outposts.

\textit{Clarification: Worlds still fire on jump troops. Regulars that land in this fashion do \textbf{not} receive a +1 modifier in their favor against planetary defense fire.}

\subsubsection{Confused Fighting} (1)

When: Start of Space Combat.

Do not make range determination rolls this combat. Every ship may fire at whatever range it wishes, using either missile or beam factors.
