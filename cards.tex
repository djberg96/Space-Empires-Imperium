\section{IMPERIUM CARDS}
\hfill

This variant adds a deck of cards (henceforth the Imperium Deck) that both players will use over the course of the game. These cards can affect movement, production and combat in various ways. This adds a bit of flavor and chaos to the game and, hopefully, makes the game a bit more interesting.

Shuffle the cards in the Imperium Deck and place it face down somewhere within easy reach of both players.

\subsection{Deal the Cards}

At the start of a war, each player receives cards from the Imperium Deck equal to the number of worlds they control. This is considered your minimum hand size.

\textit{For the first scenario, for example, each player would receive three cards.}

Your cards are secret and should be kept hidden from your opponent until played.

\subsection{Drawing More Cards}

During each player's maintenance and production phase the active player draws a number of cards that brings them back up to their minimum hand size (if below your minimum). After drawing up to your minimum hand size the active player may discard cards for 3 RU each. Cards discarded in this fashion are not replaced until the following turn.

You may also buy additional cards at a cost of 7 RU per card. You may not discard a card that you purchased in the same turn that you purchased it.

\subsection{Hand Limit}

You may hold a maximum number of cards in your hand equal to the combined number of connected worlds and outposts that you control. If you draw cards in excess of this number, you must immediately discard down to your hand limit.

\subsection{Discards and Reshuffling}

Cards played over the course of the game are placed into a discard pile. The moment the last card is drawn from the deck, reshuffle all of the discarded back into the Imperium Deck.

\textit{Note that some cards may also cause the discarded cards to be reshuffled back into the deck earlier than expected!}

\subsection{Between Wars}

Cards may not be held between wars. Any cards still in your hand at the end of the final turn of the game must either be discarded for 3 RU each or used to automatically pay the maintenance cost of a ship instead of rolling, one card per ship.
